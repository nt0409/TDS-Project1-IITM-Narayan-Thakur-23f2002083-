Friends of Animals, a student-run volunteer group, has become their only family ‚Äîfeeding them , treating their wounds , taking them to the vet after accidents , and ensuring they aren‚Äôt lost to disease or suffering.\nThese students don‚Äôt do it for credit or recognition.

Your support can be the difference between suffering in silence or healing in care.\nI am part of the Friends of Animals group at IIT Madras, which is a group of in-person campus students that share a common goal for taking care of cats. Apart from the members of the group that fund care for cats ( Cats in a critical condition due to infections, wounds due to territorial fights, accidents due to careless driving, neutering, spaying, and other care), we are not able to help all cats in the campus as we severely fall short of funds and hence we depend on people‚Äôs generous funding as the sole source of money after a point.\nIn case you are willing to donate any amount of money towards this noble cause, please feel free to do so. As an animal lover, it feels extremely sad to be unable to reach out to the animals who plead for help just because we fall short of funds.

    "text": "Understanding the Dropout and Placement Gaps in the IIT Madras Online BS Program: Are Flexibility and Accessibility Enough , I was going through some official documents and placement reports about the IIT Madras Online BS in Data Science & Applications. It‚Äôs great that they‚Äôre making quality education accessible to everyone, but a few things really stood out to me:\n\nA lot of students aren‚Äôt making it all the way to the BS level. Many drop out after the Foundation or Diploma stages.\nThe placement rate is also lower compared to the regular IIT BTech programs. For online BS students, it‚Äôs around 60% with an avg package of ‚Çπ10 LPA, whereas BTech students get over 80% placements with an avg of ‚Çπ22 LPA.\nMany students feel like just getting into this online degree gives them the IIT tag, which carries a lot of value in the industry. But what they don‚Äôt realize is‚Äîwhile getting in might be easy, sustaining and graduating is tough. It‚Äôs still IIT, not some regular college. You‚Äôve got to put in serious work to earn that degree.\nSource: Program Report - April 2025\nCareer Choices report - April 2025\n\nIt really got me thinking‚Äî\n\n\n\nWhat are the primary reasons students fail to continue till the BS level despite the flexible, modular format?\n\n\nHow do academic rigor, self-discipline, and lack of peer engagement contribute to dropouts?\nWhy is the placement percentage lower compared to traditional IIT programs?\nDoes the online degree carry equal recognition in the job market, and how does that affect outcomes?\nWhat can be done to improve both student retention and placement success?\n\nSo for those who‚Äôve been through it or are ahead in the journey, what‚Äôs the best advice you‚Äôd give to a Foundation-level student who‚Äôs just starting out? What should they focus on to stay consistent and reach the BS level successfully?",

    "text": "Clarification Needed! Hi @shri_krishna_pandey & @22f3000877 ,\nI have a question regarding the address and pin code fields in the vehicle parking application for the mad1 project. Right now, the wireframe shows these fields in the registration form, but I was wondering about their actual purpose:\n\n\nAre we asking for the user‚Äôs permanent address (which doesn‚Äôt change often)? If so, it might be better UX to collect this information in the profile section, rather than during registration.\nOr are we asking for the current location, which changes depending on where the user is booking a parking spot? In that case, it would make more sense to ask for it during the spot booking process.\n\n\nThe reason I‚Äôm asking is because the way the registration form currently asks for the user‚Äôs address and pin code, it feels like it‚Äôs asking for their permanent address. But as far as I know, in most real-world utility apps (like travel, parking, or delivery apps), they typically ask for the current location at the time of booking not during registration.\nSince I‚Äôve completed the rest of my project, this is the only part holding me back from zipping. I‚Äôd really appreciate your clarification so I can wrap it up accordingly.\nThanks!",

    "text": "IIT-M is your institute, isn‚Äôt it? In quite a few posts that I have come across in this forum, I have seen phrases such as the following:\n\n‚ÄúIIT-M should realise that‚Ä¶‚Äù\n‚ÄúIIT-M has not ‚Ä¶‚Äù\n‚ÄúDoes IIT-M know that‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nTo me, this sounds very similar to:\n\n‚ÄúAirtel should realise that‚Ä¶‚Äù\n‚ÄúAirtel has not‚Ä¶‚Äù\n‚ÄúDoes Airtel know that‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nAirtel is a service provider. You are availing a service. The company, Airtel in this case, and you, the user, are separate entities. There is no connection beyond that.\nIs IIT-M also a service provider or is it larger than that? Is it a B2C organisation that is serving you ‚Äúeducation‚Äù, or more practically, a degree? Is that all? For example, if you are studying in some offline college doing another degree, call it ABC institute, would you say ‚ÄúABC should realise that‚Ä¶‚Äù or would you rather say, ‚ÄúMy institute should realise that‚Ä¶‚Äù\nWhat is missing is a sense of belonging. I may be wrong, so please don‚Äôt take it in the wrong sense. I am not judging you. In fact, I was guilty of this when I was working at a startup (call it XYZ). I always used to say ‚ÄúShould XYZ implement this policy‚Äù. On hearing this, the company‚Äôs CTO and my friend used to correct me. ‚ÄúShould we implement this policy‚Äù. He did this multiple times while I was there.\n\nI would request those of you who frequent the ‚ÄúIIT-M‚Äù word in this capacity, referring to it as something disconnected from you, to ask yourself these questions. I am not suggesting that there is only one answer to this:\n\nWhy am I calling it ‚ÄúIIT-M‚Äù as though I am outside the institute?\nAm I not a part of the institute?\nWhat is an institute? In our case, is it just the portal and the TCS exam centers or is there more to it?\n\nYou can use the pronoun, we, in whichever context you want, not just in a positive context. For example, instead of saying ‚ÄúIIT-M‚Äôs lectures are bad‚Äù, does it make a difference when you say ‚ÄúOur lectures are bad‚Äù? Instead of saying, ‚ÄúIIT-M is not listening to our suggestions‚Äù, does it make a difference when you say, ‚ÄúOur institute is not listening to our suggestions‚Äù.\nIsn‚Äôt it a reasonable idea to become a part of the institute and then start thinking about fixing ‚Äúyour‚Äù institute‚Äôs problem? All institutes have problems. Our institute also has problems. Let us fix them.",

With Paradox attracting nearly 5,000 participants from all over the country, I think it‚Äôs important for us as a community to reflect on the potential risks involved.\nGiven that Paradox typically hosts around 5,000 participants from across the country, there is a significant risk that the event could inadvertently contribute to the spread of the virus and potentially turn the campus into an epicenter for the disease. The health and safety of all participants, students, faculty, and staff should remain our top priority.\nI hope the administration will thoroughly analyze the current situation and take a well-informed decision, considering that IIT Madras is a premier institution and its actions set an example for others. The safety and well-being of the community should always come first.\nThank You",

The last date to take sct is June 1 2025\nAs the OPPE examinations are scheduled for August, I anticipate that my own laptop will be repaired and fully functional by then, allowing me to continue my subsequent exams without further disruption. However, for the immediate SCT, I am facing this unforeseen technical challenge.\nI understand the importance of maintaining exam integrity and adhering to all stipulated guidelines. I am concerned about any potential implications of using a different device, particularly regarding:\n\n\nSystem Compatibility: Ensuring the alternative laptop meets all technical specifications and has the necessary software/browser configurations for the SCT platform.\n\n\nProctoring Requirements: Whether using an unfamiliar device could trigger flags with any online proctoring software, or if specific procedures need to be followed.\n\n\nSecurity Protocols: The security implications of using a different device for a high-stakes examination.\n\n\nCould you please advise on the institution‚Äôs policy regarding such situations? Specifically, I would be grateful if you could clarify:\n\n\nWhether it is permissible to take the SCT on a different laptop, given my circumstances.\n\n\nAny particular steps or permissions I need to obtain from the institution before the exam.\n\n\nIf there are any alternative arrangements the institution can provide, such as access to a supervised computer lab or a designated testing facility.\n\n\nI am committed to ensuring a smooth and compliant examination process.

I have Missed the week 2 deadline by minutes due to this issue. The PDSA course has a clause for OPPE eligibility to have week 2 avg >40. It is my sincere request to push the deadline by one day since it might cost me heavily,\nI Had already submitted a ticket last night at 1240. They replied today saying that I should upload the same on the discourse forum. Please Consider,\nThank you",

Unfortunately, I forgot to click the ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù button after completing my responses. This was an unintentional mistake, and I realized it only after the deadline had passed.\nI am concerned about how this might affect my eligibility for the OPPE in the PDSA course. Could you please clarify if missing this submission will make me ineligible for the OPPE, even though my assignment marks are otherwise satisfactory? If so, I kindly request if there is any possibility of reconsideration due to my overall performance in the assignments.\nThank you for your understanding and support. I look forward to your guidance on how to proceed.\nBest regards,\nArman",

    "text": "PDSA - OPPE eligibility conditions are very harsh and unreasonable Dear Course Support,\n@AtulPS @Manidipa2001 @satyanarayana @T.Naveen\nAfter the start of the course the grading policy for PDSA has been changed to score >=40 marks in A2, A3 ‚Ä¶till A8 in GrPA assignments. This was not there at the time of start of the term. Announcement came on 20 May just 5 days before deadline of the week. This is the online programme and with expectation of some flexibility people enroll so that they can still  work full time or travel for work etc.\nIn the week of 20th May, I was travelling could attempt only 1 out of 3 GrPA questions.\nSubmission and score >=40 for every assignment till A2 to A8 is a very strict condition for working professionals. With full time jobs, it is possible to miss 1 or 2 assignments.\nAlso there is no OPPE that can be scheduled next term if we pass the PDSA course.\nHence we have no chance to improve the OPPE marks alone which is 20% of the total. I am currently at CGPA of >9 and it would be unfair to lose 20% in OPPE just because of missing one assignment. You have got to give chance to students to appear OPPEs in a little reasonable manner. If the student is really doing well overall he/she will do well in the OPPE as well, why snatch a chance of student from even appearing for OPPE just for one or two assignments.\n Therefore, it is kindly requested that the method of average of ‚ÄúXX‚Äù best Assignments out of 8 assignments be please considered for eligibility for OPPE as was the case earlier. This way we have a chance to prove ourselves in OPPE and not lose 20 % marks in the total grading for missing a single assignment in A2 to A8. This is severe penalty for a small lapse in weekly assignment. \nNote:- In the discourse forum in relevant post, the course instructor has told us to write to support.\n\n Please consider this, it is a sincere request from students community.\n\nRegards,\nsandeepkumar",
